## Introduction

This package allows to control a Lewansoul xArm robot from a Linux PC with ROS.  It uses the HID interface between your PC and the Arduino board imbedded in the xArm.  Said Arduino board then communicates with the servos (6 of them, LX 15 D) using a serial TTL UART connection.  It is also possible to communicate directly with the servo units with a serial communication (and bypass the arduino board on the base) but this is not supported by the code in this repository.

To note, the arm is sometimes listed as a 6-DOF robot (degree of freedom) but it is actually a 5 DOF + 1 for the gripper.  So it is an under actuated arm and one can't reach all possible 3D position/orientation.

If you find bugs or want to add some extra features, don't hesitate to create a pull request :-)

## Requirements

### Software

Code tested on Linux Ubuntu 18.04 using Python 2.  The following packages are required:
```sh
sudo apt install libhidapi-hidraw0 libhidapi-libusb0 python-hid
pip install --user easyhid
```

### Permissions

The HID device is created with the permissions `root.root`, `0600` by default which means that users can communicate with the robot unless they escalate to root privileges (`sudo`).

To avoid this you should create a `udev` rule.  To get the proper attributes, you must first identify the `hidraw` device created for your device.  You can use `dmesg -w` in a shell and then plug/power on the arm.  Let's assume it's `hidraw3` and launch `sudo udevadm info --attribute-walk /dev/hidraw3 | less`.

You can create a rule using the product name since it seems specific enough to identify the xArm Arduino board.  Create the file
`/etc/udev/rules.d/80-usb-xarm.rules` with the content `SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw", ATTRS{product}=="LOBOT", GROUP="dialout", MODE="0660"` (note that all users will need to be members of the group `dialout`).  To apply the rules without rebooting: `sudo udevadm control --reload-rules` and `sudo udevadm trigger` (this is a one time setup).

### `hidraw` device not created properly

The last issue is a lot more annoying and we don't have a good fix.  From time to time, the `hidraw` device is not properly created.  I found an error message in ` /var/log/syslog` related to FuEngine.  This seems to be a feature to automatically check/upgrade a device's firmware.  The only way we found to avoid this is to disable the service `fwupd` using `sudo service fwupd stop` (has to be done after every reboot) or ` sudo apt remove fwupd ` (completely remove fwupd).  If anyone has a better solution, please raise your hand.

## Build

```sh
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
catkin build
```

## Usage

```python
import math
import lewansoul_xarm
c = lewansoul_xarm.controller()
HIDDevice:
    /dev/hidraw3 | 483:5750 | MyUSB_HID | LOBOT | 49770F673737
    release_number: 513
    usage_page: 0
    usage: 0
    interface_number: 0
connected to xArm controller serial number: 49770F673737
a = c.add_arm(5, 4, 3)
a.disable() # turn off servos
# now manually move the arm to zero position
a.calibrate() # this is a one time thing, you can re-use the calibration later on
a.home()
a.is_homed()
p = a.measured_jp()
p[0] = p[0] + math.pi / 4.0 # start with a small motion
a.move_jp(p)
```


## ROS notes

```sh
sudo apt install ros-melodic-joint-state-publisher-gui
```

To start the controller ROS node:
```sh
rosrun lewansoul_xarm xArm-ros.py
```

To calibrate (this has to be done for `/xArm` and `/gripper`):
```sh
rostopic pub -1 /xArm/disable std_msgs/Empty "{}"
# now move the arm to zero position
rostopic pub -1 /xArm/calibrate std_msgs/Empty "{}"
rostopic pub -1 /xArm/enable std_msgs/Empty "{}"
```

For RViz:
```sh
roslaunch lewansoul_xarm display.launch
```
